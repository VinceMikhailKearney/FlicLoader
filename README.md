# FlicLoader
A wee app that takes text and looks for images using the Flickr API that are associated with the text! The user can download multiple folders of 'Flics' that match different text.

When the user enters text and selects the number of images to download, using the Flickr API, images are fetched that match this text.
The images that are downloaded are saved as a 'Flic' and are added to a 'FlicFolder'. Each folder is then added to a manager and the user can select a folder from a table to view the Flics that are saved within the folder.
